[{"content":" Exploring the Tipico Website # First, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the structure of the Tipico website. It has four categories: all, today, 3hrs and 48hrs. However, from the website itself, we can\u0026rsquo;t list all the matches for a specific sport. Instead, we can list all matches for a particular league within that sport. This leads us to the URL structure, which looks like this:\nhttps://sports.tipico.de/de/alle/fussball/deutschland/3-liga\nBut what if we remove unnecessary details like deutschland and 3-liga? Doing so gives us this link:\nhttps://sports.tipico.de/de/alle/fussball/\nVoila! The website now lists all football matches. You can also limit the number of matches displayed using time parameters.\nList of all matches for the sporttype football Scraping Data # How do we scrape the data? The first idea is to use Selenium, a framework for automating web browser interactions. However, Selenium loads all JavaScript and CSS, which can slow down the scraping process. So, let\u0026rsquo;s try a different method: using a GET request to obtain the data. The advantage over Selenium is that we receive only raw data without loading CSS or JavaScript. To find the GET request, we need to open the Developer Tools and filter for Fetch/XHR in the network tab. Using the search function (Ctrl+F) to find a match listed, we locate the GET request.\nIn this case we search for KCC FC and found the GET request We attempt to create a GET request on the URL without headers to see if Tipico blocks it, and we discover that we don\u0026rsquo;t need cookies or other parameters to obtain raw data. Jackpot!\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the parameters in the URL:\nparameter description oneSectionResult Displays matches for the user interface, showing only one section basketball Specifies the number of markets shown for a match icehockey Sets the language For testing purposes, we\u0026rsquo;ll remove all three parameters:\nhttps://sports.tipico.de/json/program/selectedEvents/all/1101\nBut what does 1101 mean? We previously chose football as the sport. Let\u0026rsquo;s try selecting a different sport, like basketball. Now a different GET request is sent:\nhttps://sports.tipico.de/json/program/selectedEvents/all/2101\nOnly the first digit has changed! From this, we can create a table:\nsportype id football 1 basketball 2 icehockey 4 tennis 5 handball 6 rugby 12 Data Structure # What we receive is a JSON file. The JSON file structure, focusing on the essential attributes, looks like this:\nSELECTION/ ├── ... ├── events/ │ ├── \u0026#34;580284510\u0026#34;/ │ │ ├── ... │ │ ├── \u0026#34;team1\u0026#34; │ │ ├── \u0026#34;team2\u0026#34; │ │ └── ... │ └── ... ├── ... ├── matchOddGroups/ │ ├── \u0026#34;580284510\u0026#34;/ │ │ ├── \u0026#34;standard\u0026#34; │ │ ├── \u0026#34;double-chance\u0026#34; │ │ ├── \u0026#34;handicap\u0026#34; │ │ └── ... │ └── ... └── ... Each match has a unique ID, in this case, 580284510. In the events section, you can find the names of the teams, while the matchOddGroups section provides details on different types of bets for each match.\n","date":"25.09.2023","permalink":"/projects/1-tipico/","section":"Projekte","summary":"This guide covers scraping match data from the Tipico website, encompassing URL structure, data scraping methods, parameter manipulation, and the JSON data structure.","title":"A Guide to Match Scraping in Tipico"},{"content":"Interest in computer science and a particular passion for cybersecurity.\n","date":"25.09.2023","permalink":"/","section":"Bui Anh Minh Leon Phan","summary":"Interest in computer science and a particular passion for cybersecurity.","title":"Bui Anh Minh Leon Phan"},{"content":" ","date":"25.09.2023","permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projekte","summary":" ","title":"Projekte"},{"content":"","date":"25.09.2023","permalink":"/tags/scraping/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"scraping"},{"content":"","date":"25.09.2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"25.09.2023","permalink":"/tags/tipico/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"tipico"},{"content":" Test # Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to follow me on Twitter.
